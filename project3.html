        <h1><strong>WhatsApp Redesign</strong></h1>
        <h4>
          Since launching in 2009, WhatsApp has quickly become the world’s most
          popular text and voice messaging application. More than 1 billion
          people in over 180 countries use WhatsApp to stay in touch with
          friends and family anytime and anywhere. WhatsApp is free and offers
          simple, secure, reliable messaging and calling, especially for small
          collaborative workgroups. And yes, the name WhatsApp is a pun on the
          phrase What's Up. In February 2014, Facebook purchased the messaging
          service WhatsApp for $19 billion — to become one of the largest tech
          buys of all time.

          This is a WhatsApp redesign concept for my capstone project. I've
          always been a fan of WhatsApp and use it daily to communicate with
          international friends and family. Compared with other similar
          applications, WhatsApp requires you to share your cellphone number,
          and some people may prefer to keep this information private. However,
          when tested with users, it reveals a few pain points that they face
          while using certain features. I saw much potential for improvement in
          the app and ways to excel in the company further. With many ideas
          flowing through my mind, I decided to focus on the WhatsApp Web.
          WhatsApp Web allows you to send and receive WhatsApp messages online
          on your Desktop PC or Tablet.

          WhatsApp Messenger takes the lead in multiple countries even when
          comparing all social and communication apps by the length of average
          monthly sessions per user. WhatsApp usage dominates in India, Brazil,
          Netherlands, Spain, and Italy:

          quality of mobile data, will continue growing in the coming years.<br /><br />

          <strong>2.</strong> WhatsApp will continue to grow its user base while
          redefining itself to be more than a communication app.<br /><br />

          <strong>3.</strong> Messaging apps marketing is likely to become the
          next big thing in social media advertising.<br /><br />
          <strong>4.</strong> WhatsApp Statistics are becoming more and more
          relevant to businesses but the quality and clarity of their
          presentation are lagging behind.<br /><br />
          <strong>5.</strong> WhatsApp usage is specific to countries and even
          region within the countries. Always check whether or not the global
          data accurately reflects your user base.

        <h3>Understanding the users</h3>

        <h4>
          The first UX challenge that I encountered on this project was finding
          the limitation within the WhatsApp Web platform. In doing so, I had to
          completely break Whatsapp into sections in order to have a clear
          understanding of how it works and what the user gets by using it. The

          deployed to discover pain points and behaviors surrounding the
          WhatsApp app. Most of the participants who were interview and filled
          out were men. The ages varied between 20–35 years. Below are the

            longtime friends. Skype is not only a great way to call for free,
            but it also allows for text messaging with your contacts. Unlike
            WhatsApp, you’ll have to approve contacts before you can start
            sending messages but its reliability and stability make it a
            suitable replacement.

            Currently, there is no option for video calling in Telegram. Only an
            audio calling facility is available. But we can record video and
            send to our contacts.

            <h7>Facebook Messenger</h7> is finally getting desktop apps almost 9
            years after its debut. After seeing over a 100% increase in desktop
            browser audio and video calling, Messenger today releases its Mac
            and Windows desktop apps. The only drawback is that you can’t use it
            to communicate with friends who are not on Facebook.

          methods, such as usability testing and task analyses, personas are
          vital to launching a useful and usable solution. Enter Rajeev, Larry,
          and Jessie, three vastly different personas to embody the full range

          user’s paths and the platform’s structure.

          validate my design decisions through testing. To do this, I used Maze
          to test mission-based tasks and InVision to conduct in-person
          usability tests using a wireframe clickable prototype and a

            style="color:blue"

          Both served as key tools to gather feedback that informed revisions to
          key action items.

          Finally, referring back to the problem objectives, I knew I had to
          address the group message and contacts search for the WhatsApp
          interfaces.

        <h4>
          <b>Pain Point 1: Group Chat Functionality Features.</b> In the case of
          navigation, the Menu on the top left groups irrelevant features
          together, making it difficult for the user to understand WhatsApp's
          functionality features.

        <img class="add" src="images/WhatsApp/new.png" alt="calls" />
        <h6>Add New Group Chat</h6>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <b><ins>Recommendation 1.</ins></b> In this feature, the user can
          access the functions, including “New Group”, “New Broadcast Lists”,
          “New Secret Chat”. This will be convenient and relevant for their
          daily WhatsApp uses.

        <h6>Add Participants to New Group</h6>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          <b>Pain Point 2: Finding a Contact</b> There are two ways to start a
          new chat: 1) Search within the Chats list, 2) Go to New Chat icon on
          top and search contact. The user was not clear to differentiate
          between these two options. Searching in Chats list gives an assumption
          that search will run through the Chats list only, and in fact, it
          works for both Chats and Contacts. On the other side, the New Chat
          option also provides a list of Chats as well as Contacts.

        <img class="add" src="images/WhatsApp/Add.png" alt="add" />
        <h6>Search a New Contact</h6>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <b><ins>Recommendation 2.</ins></b> A clear separation between Chats
          and Contacts needs to provide. This can be done by giving a filter
          option in the Contact list, or a single record can be sorted based on
          Recent Chats or Contact names.

        <h4>
          <b>Pain Point 3: Preview and Attaching Photos</b> The close icon with
          the Preview title is confusing. The user clicked it to close the
          preview of selected photos, but it discards all the selected photos.
          Adding more files option is not clear. The Attach icon still displays
          on top, but it is not functional. The user clicked on that icon first.
          It is difficult to navigate a large number of selected files.

        <h6>Preview Media Files in Menu Dropdown</h6>
        <br />
        <h4>
          <b><ins>Recommendation 3.</ins></b> I believe moving the important
          features of the application to organize all of the relevant features
          to one icon on the bottom right of the screen- that is the most
          effective way in terms of the thumb area. But for the desktop version,
          I have also created a dropdown option in the menu renamed to Media
          Files to avoid any confusion for the user. Users can easily find what
          kind of files they what to shard by clicking the Media Files from the
          Menu icon.

          I decided to work on WhatsApp application for desktop because I
          usually reply to messages while I am on desktop working. I hope my
          idea will be a real application soon. What I made here is a concept
          for Mac application, according to the new Mojave OSX style guide.

        <h4>
          After gathering data from the existing product and competitors, I was
          ensuring an understanding of the business goals for the project and
          ready to start my WhatsApp redesigning in earnest. I created a site
          map and user flow of the information architecture to tested my
          redesign with users. Once I get feedback on what they like about and
          what may frustrate them. I start my wireframing and building
          prototypes. I leared an amazing user experience redesign can only be
          provided by following an iterative and intricate design process.
          Finally, we reach the end of my project. There are still a lot of
          things that I don’t know about UI/UX, but I always challenge myself to
          keep learning and be a better designer every single day.
