          concept of public transit trackers isn’t new but it does offer up a
          wealth of opportunities to work with imperfect data that is incredibly
          important to the users of a given app or service. Transit officials
          have identified a problem they would like to solve. Due to expansion,
          numerous bus routes have been recently added and many of those routes
          stop at the same bus stop. Riders want to know what the next arriving
          bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Simply
          rushing to the stop when you see a bus coming no longer works because
          it might not be the bus the rider is expecting Riders are currently
          complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which
          has seven bus lines serving the stop.

          Any public transport app comes with a set of features to help people
          move around a city using all the transportation options it has to
          offer. Transit maps are complicated. Each city has it’s a unique set
          of complex public transportation networks, some with just subways and
          buses, others with cable cars, streetcars, and light rails. And The
          app must combine a simple interface with abundant functionality to
          serve its purpose.<br /><br />
          <b
            >How might we solve bus riders' frustrations by giving them two
            basic pieces of information: what bus is arriving next? And how much
            time do they have to get to the bus stop? </b
          ><br /><br />
          Due to a recent expansion, numerous bus routes have been recently
          added and many of these routes stop at the same bus stop. The simple
          answer is to create an app that will give the bus riders the needed
          information to make the correct decision and alleviate tension. Asking
          the who, the what, the when, where and how were important questions in
          our next process.

        <h1><strong>Discovery phase</strong></h1>
        <h2><mark>CHAPTER #2 — The Power of Research</mark></h2>
        <h4>
          Understanding bus riders was important to developing a research plan.
          The design concept needed to be grounded in research from real user
          needs not simply from holes within the current market. First, a
          competitive usability evaluation was conducted with 5 users to
          understand what works well and what are some pain points.
          Additionally, a diverse group of public transportation riders were
          surveyed regarding their mobile-app public transportation preferences
          and attitudes.

          Above are the results from a semi-annual onboard customer satisfaction
          survey. 88% of respondents were satisfied with their local
          transportation overall service, and 90% were likely to continue riding
          public transportation. And the bus services have improved their
          satisfaction through the years.

        <img class="icons" src="images/users.png" alt="users" />

        <h4>
          According to my
          <a

            style="color:blue"
            >survey</a
          >, there were three major learnings:<br /><br />

          <strong>1.</strong> Bus riders rely heavily on apps whether it is
          Google maps or local transit apps. The key insight gained here is that
          riders are tired of the apps giving them incorrect data. (Typically
          local transit apps as opposed to Google Maps)<br /><br />

          <strong>2.</strong> Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is
          and how much time they have to get to the bus stop.<br /><br />

          <strong>3.</strong> We learned through several iterations that users
          simply want to get from A-to-B. This was evident through observation
          and feedback that users were visibly frustrated xxxx. But it caused
          frustration because users just wanted the basic local route times.
        </h4>
        <img class="icons" src="images/analysis.png" alt="analysis" />
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <h4>
          There is Google Maps easily to find the right timing and pathway to
          get to your destination, and then there’s Moovit, a
          public-transit-tracking app. There are both our competitors. The goal
          is to not only help plan trips but also keep users informed with basic
          information that they already need. Users might need an arrival time
          because they know where they’re trying to go. For an app like ours,
          users will have a similar experience inside the app to what they see
          in reality, that’s what’s most important. The app will provide alerts
          in the event of delays and shutdowns in addition to tracking regular
          bus routes in real-time. And another prominent feature is you can load
          money onto the app and scan the QR code to pay.

          <h7>
            Google Maps
          </h7>
          is a web mapping service developed by Google. It offers satellite
          imagery, aerial photography, street maps, 360° panoramic views of
          streets, real-time traffic conditions, and route planning for
          traveling by foot, car, bicycle, and air, or public transportation.<br /><br />
          <b>Positioning:</b><br />
          Google is probably the world’s best-known company for pioneering the
          search engine revolution and providing a means for the internet users
          of the world to search and find information at the click of a mouse.
          Further, Google is also known for its work in organizing information
          in a concise and precise manner that has been a game changer for the
          internet economy and by extension, the global economy because
          corporations, individuals, and consumers can search and access
          information about anything, anywhere and anytime.<br /><br />
          <b>Primary Audience:</b><br />
          The campaign’s focus was on getting iOS users between the ages of 20
          and 40 to engage with the Google Maps brand, specifically targeting
          high-consumption mobile users. The demographic targeting was broad
          because Google Maps is a product everyone can use, and mobile gamers
          have become synonymous with mobile users. Approximately 73 percent of
          the campaign’s target audience plays online games at least once per
          month.<br /><br />
          <b>Differentiators:</b> Google Maps allows you to download maps of
          certain areas and neighborhoods to your phone so that they can be
          accessed offline. It’s important to note that you will need to be
          connected to the Internet in order to save these maps to your device.
          But once they’ve been downloaded, you’ll be able to access them
          anytime, whether your phone is online or offline. There are also some
          limitations to keep in mind. When downloading maps for offline use,
          you’ll only be able to access driving directions, since transit,
          bicycling, and walking directions are only available online.<br /><br />

            Moovit
          </h7>
          offers a real-time journey planner mobile and web app to navigate
          public transit networks with GPS navigation across transit modes,
          including buses, ferries, rapid transit (metro/subway/underground,
          etc.) trains, trams, and trolleybuses. Users can access a live map,
          and view nearby stops and stations based on their current GPS
          location, as well as plan trips across transportation modes based on
          real-time data.<br /><br />
          <b>Positioning:</b><br />
          For people that use public transportation a lot, or who rarely use it
          but need to on occasion, it can be difficult at times to figure out
          where you need to be to get where you need to go. Which route to
          choose, which stops to wait at, and times of departure can all be
          pretty daunting, and can slightly change the whim. Fortunately, there
          is an app for that. Moovit is divided into three simple categories:
          directions, stations, and lines. This lets you route your trip or
          search for real-time arrival information at any bus stop or train
          station in your city. If you’re a world traveler and only have space
          on your phone for one app, Moovit is your best bet!<br /><br />
          <b>Primary Audience and Differentiators:</b> Moovit is designed to
          track the current public transit routes and travel times. A user
          simply needs to input a destination, allow the app to track the
          current location, and pick a route that they would prefer to take.
          Once it transit, a user can run the route, and it will track your
          current location and all the stops in between where you started and
          where you want to go, noticing you how many stops left and when you
          should request your stop. The app is available in 1,400 cities in 77
          countries (and 43 different languages, as a result). Moovit’s true
          distinction from other transit apps is its massive database of user
          data. The company combines publicly available data with live
          information from 60 million users.<br /><br />

          colors combination of energy and trust. It uses a split-complementary

        <h3>Round 1: Testing the wireframe prototype</h3>
        <h4>
          If I had moved onto wireframe testing at this point in the process, I
          would have overlooked some of the most glaring issues living within my
          wireframes. Before moving onto high fidelity mockups, I needed to
          validate my design decisions through testing. To do this, I conducted
          Usability Tests with 3 participants with this prototype in-person
          usability tests using a wireframe clickable prototype and a

        <br />
        <h4>
          The participants were given different scenarios such as “You are
          walking towards the nearest bus stop on Washington and State and need
          to check all the incoming buses.” Some of my key takeaways from the
          usability test were that users liked the visual representation of the
          buses on the app but said they wanted to differentiate between the bus
          lines.

          Keeping the branding and user flows in mind, I transformed my
          wireframes into high fidelity mockups by weaving in the branding to
          build the final prototype.

          Busybus is a real-time journey planner mobile app to navigate public
          transit networks with GPS navigation across transit modes, including
          buses, ferries, rapid transit, trains, trams, and trolleybuses. Users
          can access real-time location sharing and offline functionality, which
          offers downloadable maps. Also, you can load money onto the app and
          scan the QR code when getting on the train to pay. We dream of happier
          communities, where multiple modes work together, and getting from A to
          B with Transit is simpler than climbing into a car. Our cities came
          long before the car, and will still be around after all the cars are
          gone.

        <h3>User Testing Results</h3>
        <br />
        <h4>
          User testing brought about positive interest; they like the payment
          option on the app. However, improvements can be made. Several
          participants pointed out unclear navigation from screen-to-screen.
          This is a usability issue that I would address by adding a ‘back’
          button. One participant further suggested exploring notifications for
          bus delays. Overall, the testing prototype was a solid first step in
          surfacing feedback and design directions.

          <b>Finding 1.</b> I used Maze to test usability testing, and it shows
          the average time spent on the screens is good, and overall, our
          mission gets 91.7% with the expected path. But the misclick rate is
          high, might consider adding a text label to the navigation bar on the
          bottom.

          UX design has many parts, and putting all those parts together to come
          up with a workable solution was challenging. I have grown a lot
          through this process and gained valuable insight into the design
          process. Having minimal information on a final product and no content
          presented its own set of challenges. If I had more time to work on
          this project, I would have gotten more creative with some of the
          features that I offered in my solution. Data showed that some
          participants indicated that they would like to see newer technology
          used. Something critical that I found out from users is that even in
          this era of technology, there are still so many people who could care
          less about it and didn’t feel they needed to conduct their life
          functions. I will use this experience and the knowledge gained through
          this process to continue learning, so I can be a part of creating
          beautiful user experiences for future product users.
